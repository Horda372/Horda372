PMO & Project Coordinator with a passion for AI, Machine Learning, and Data Analysis

Focused on continuous development and process optimisation. I combine professional experience in project governance and PMO operations with a solid technical background in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Data Analysis. I utilise AI tools to streamline workflows, manage resources efficiently, and maintain stakeholder alignment.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Telecommunications and am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science with a specialisation in AI and ML. I have successfully led multiple AI-driven projects, delivering scalable solutions under strict time and resource constraints.
